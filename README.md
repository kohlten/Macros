# Macros
Simple macro program

This program current just takes a string and types it very quickly.

My current aspirations for this project are:
    Add a GUI,
    Make it an actual macro software,

Dependencies:
    For windows, if compiling from source, you need win32pi, pythoncom and pyhook. Most of which should come from pywin32 and     
    ActivePython. 
    For linux you need xlib.
    
    Mac is currently not supported, although I hope it will be eventually.
